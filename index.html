            To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star from Earth, astronomers use the principle of parallax. Here, the term parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit.

            "Preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, it's the only home we've ever known." “The richness I achieve comes from Nature, the source of my inspiration.” “Tranquility, serenity, and beauty of nature taught me how to find happiness in life and in the silence of eternity.” “Storms make trees take deeper roots.”
